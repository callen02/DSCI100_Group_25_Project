#Introduction
#Chronic kideny disease (CKD) refers to a gradual loss and impairment of the kidneys functions in filtering wastes and excess fluids from the blood.
#In the intial stages of CKD, signs and symtoms can be minimal. However, in advanced CKD, as dangerous levels of fluid and wastes build up within the body, 
symptoms can include persistent high blood pressure (hypertension) that is difficult to control, shortness of breath due to fluiud build-up in the lungs, 
#among others. Conditions and diseases often associated with an increased risk of CKD include: type 1 or type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure/hypertension, 
#smoking, obesity, older age, as well as, cardiovascular disease.
#Utilizing ckd_clean.csv, which includes data regarding measures of 400 patients, 250 of those with CKD and the remaining 150 rows without CKD, 
#we will attempt to classify a new observation/patient as possessing CKD or not possessing CKD. The measures we will be utilizing in order to perform this 
#classification are age, blood pressure, albumin blood urea, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and the presence of pus cells in urine.
